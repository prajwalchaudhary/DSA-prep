Stickler Thief :

Stickler the thief wants to loot money from the houses arranged in a line. He cannot loot two consecutive houses and aims to maximize his total loot.
Given an array, arr[] where arr[i] represents the amount of money in the i-th house.
Determine the maximum amount he can loot.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [6, 5, 5, 7, 4]
Output: 15
Explanation: Maximum amount he can get by looting 1st, 3rd and 5th house. Which is 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.
