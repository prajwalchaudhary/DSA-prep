Ways to Reach the n'th Stair :

There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

Examples:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to climb 1 stair. 

Solution :

//{ Driver Code Starts
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


// } Driver Code Ends

class Solution {
  public:
    int countWays(int n) {
        if(n==1)return 1;
        if(n==2)return 2;
        
        int prev1 = 1;
        int prev2 = 2;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            sum = prev1 + prev2;
            prev1 = prev2;
            prev2 = sum;
        }
        return sum;
        
    }
};



//{ Driver Code Starts.
int main() {
    // taking total testcases
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        // taking stair count
        int m;
        cin >> m;
        Solution ob;
        cout << ob.countWays(m) << endl; // Print the output from our pre computed array

        cout << "~"
             << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}

// } Driver Code Ends
