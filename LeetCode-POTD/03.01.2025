NUMBER OF WAYS TO SPLIT ARRAY :

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

nums contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:

The sum of the first i + 1 elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last n - i - 1 elements.
There is at least one element to the right of i. That is, 0 <= i < n - 1.
Return the number of valid splits in nums.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,4,-8,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
There are three ways of splitting nums into two non-empty parts:
- Split nums at index 0. Then, the first part is [10], and its sum is 10. The second part is [4,-8,7], and its sum is 3. Since 10 >= 3, i = 0 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 1. Then, the first part is [10,4], and its sum is 14. The second part is [-8,7], and its sum is -1. Since 14 >= -1, i = 1 is a valid split.
- Split nums at index 2. Then, the first part is [10,4,-8], and its sum is 6. The second part is [7], and its sum is 7. Since 6 < 7, i = 2 is not a valid split.
Thus, the number of valid splits in nums is 2.

Solution :

class Solution {
public:
    int waysToSplitArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        // Keep track of sum of elements on left and right sides
        long long leftSum=0,rightSum=0;
        // Initially all elements are on right side
        for(int num:nums){
            rightSum+=num;
        }
        int count=0;
        // Try each possible split position
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size()-1;i++){
            // Move current element from right to left side
            leftSum+=nums[i];
            rightSum-=nums[i];

            // Check if this creates a valid split
            if(leftSum>=rightSum){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
