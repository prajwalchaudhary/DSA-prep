3208. Alternating Groups II :

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers colors and an integer k. The color of tile i is represented by colors[i]:

colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.
An alternating group is every k contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (each tile in the group except the first and last one has a different color from its left and right tiles).

Return the number of alternating groups.

Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be next to each other.

Example 1:

Input: colors = [0,1,0,1,0], k = 3

Output: 3

Solution :

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfAlternatingGroups(vector<int>& colors, int k) {
        int length = colors.size();
        int result = 0;
        // Tracks the length of the current alternating sequence
        int alternatingElementsCount = 1;
        int lastColor = colors[0];

        // Loop through the array, including the wrap-around (circular check)
        for (int i = 1; i < length + k - 1; i++) {
            // Use modulo to handle circular traversal
            int index = i % length;

            // Check if current color is the same as last color
            if (colors[index] == lastColor) {
                // Pattern breaks, reset sequence length
                alternatingElementsCount = 1;
                lastColor = colors[index];
                continue;
            }

            // Extend alternating sequence
            alternatingElementsCount += 1;

            // If sequence length reaches at least k, count it
            if (alternatingElementsCount >= k) {
                result++;
            }

            lastColor = colors[index];
        }

        return result;
    }
};
