1980. Find Unique Binary String :

Given an array of strings nums containing n unique binary strings each of length n, return a binary string of length n that does not appear in nums. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

Example 1:

Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
Explanation: "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

Solution :

class Solution {
public:
    string findDifferentBinaryString(vector<string>& nums) {
        string ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            char curr = nums[i][i];
            ans += curr == '0' ? '1' : '0';
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
