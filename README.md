# DSA-prep
A collection of data structures and algorithms problems with their solutions, curated during my DSA preparation journey.

# DSA Preparation Repository

Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) preparation repository! This repository contains solutions to a variety of DSA problems that I have solved as part of my preparation journey. The solutions are written in C++.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the topic or type of problem:

- **Basic Maths**
- **Basic Recursion**
- **Basic Hashing**
- **Sorting Techniques**
- **Arrays**
- **Binary Search**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Advance Recursion**
- **Bit Manipulation**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Sliding Window and Two Pointer Combined Problems**
- **Heaps**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Binary Trees**
- **Binary Search Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Tries**

Each folder contains multiple problem statements and their corresponding solutions.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the different folders and files. Each solution is self-contained, with comments explaining the logic and approach used.
